                    <h1> Vegan Meal Plan </h1>

                    <p> Vegan diets have been linked to a variety of health benefits, including improved weight management 
                        and protection against certain chronic diseases. However, finding balanced, healthy meals on a vegan diet 
                        can often be difficult and overwhelming. If improperly planned, vegan diets may cause nutritional deficiencies 
                        and health problems. A healthy vegan diet should contain a variety of whole grains, proteins, healthy fats, and fruits 
                        and vegetables. Foods like nuts, seeds, legumes, soy products, and nutritional yeast can all help boost your protein intake
                        throughout the day. Meanwhile, avocado oil, coconut oil, and olive oil are nutritious, vegan-friendly choices for healthy fats.</p>

                    <h1> Healthy Vegan Snacks</h1>

                    <p> Coming up with healthy snack ideas that fit a vegan diet can be challenging. This is because the vegan diet includes only plant foods
                        and excludes all animal products, limiting the selection of snack foods. Luckily, countless combinations of plant foods can make up 
                        healthy and satisfying snacks — whether you eat fully vegan or are simply interested in reducing animal products in your diet.<br><br>

                    <h1> Vegan Sweet Tooth</h1>

                    <p> Snacks are truly a godsend—they can get you through a busy work week, a cram session in a dimly lit library basement, and even the kind of
                        colossal breakup that leaves you ugly-crying in that same sad basement searching for something to eat your woes away. To our delight, a number
                        of companies have been making accidentally vegan snacks for years, and we’ve compiled a list of a few of our favorite go-to treats you can find 
                        practically anywhere. Check this list for the next time you’re on a road trip in the middle of nowhere, in need of something to munch on at the 
                        movies, or trying to get through a difficult moment and are in need of some sweet or salty fuel.<br>
