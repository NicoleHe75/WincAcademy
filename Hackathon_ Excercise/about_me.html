                <h1> About Me</h1>

                <p> My name is Nicole and I live in the Netherlands. After feeling the joy of being a vegetarian for 5 years I can
                    now proudly say that I am a vegan for more than 2 years. I am still surprised how many products we consume
                    or use that contain animal products although it's so easy to substitute them for a non-cruelty version. 
                    I used to think that those grass eating tree-hugging vegans only eat bland and tasteless food. Now I know better
                    and the food actually tasts much better and more intense. Especially when you realize that an animal didn't suffer 
                    because of it. I didn't know anything about the dairy and egg-industry, but after seeing a documentary about these industries
                    it was easy to make the step from veggie to vegan. The only thing I regret is that I didn't go Vegan earlier in life and just started
                    in my 40's.

                <h1> My Journey to Plantbased</h1>

                <p> In January of 2019 with the recommendation of a co-worker, I watched “What The Health” and “Forks Over Knives”.  I was 
                    shocked and knew then if I didn’t change how I ate, it could spiral out of control. I hated being not energetic, feeling bloated 
                    and I was eager to embark on this journey. But now the question – what is the next step? How do I start this?
                    I decided the healthiest way was to embark on a whole food plant-based diet (WFPB). Like many, I became lost with not knowing 
                    exactly what to do and the questions began. Where exactly does one begin? How much am I supposed to actually eat? There is sugar 
                    in fruit so is it really good for us? Is this OK – is that OK? Do you cleanse first? What is the difference between plant-based and 
                    whole food plant-based? So many questions and I didn’t know where to turn for help.
                    One thing I didn’t do was I never gave up and continued to seek answers.  I knew if I gave up, I would never get to experience the 
                    rewards of being healthy again. Likewise, how great it has been to eat a whole food plant-based diet. Within the first month, I could 
                    feel the difference. In the 2nd and 3rd months, I felt a great amount of energy. We’re talking tons of energy.
                    In summary, it is my desire to be able to help others on their journey. I want everyone to have all the tools they need to set them up 
                    for success. Eating a whole food plant-based diet changed my live!<br><br>

                <h1> My favorite books</h1>

                <p> Veganism is popping up everywhere these days. We have started to recognize that our planet is in desperate need of a gentler treatment and 
                    so are our fellow sentient beings. The richest countries eating the most animal products have brought about the sickest populations and finally, more 
                    and more health experts start recommending vegan diets. But with all this new information around living a vegan lifestyle, where should you even start?
                    I’ve gotten an incredible amount of questions around vegan nutrition, ethics, treating diseases, and getting kids on board that I thought it was about 
                    time to put together a list of the best vegan books out there!                    
                    Let’s be honest, having a bunch of beautiful books on your shelf at home doesn’t just look pretty but will also keep you on track and maybe even spark 
                    the interest of people around you. <br>
